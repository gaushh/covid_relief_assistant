# Covid Relief Assistant
This repo contqains the source code of a AI-based conversational assistant (chatbot).

## The current version of the chatbot has following features:
1) Provide automated response to covid related FAQs.
2) Provide hospital bed availability info to users by routing them to portals set up by Govt.
3) Provide helpline numbers set up by Govt. and NGOS for people seeking help.


I am not deploying this chatbot because of bandwidth constraint, monetary constraint and lack of a proper platform.
You are welcome to improve the bot or build upon this bot by taking it as a baseline.

If you're an NGO and need help deploying this/such assistant on your platform (website/app), feel free to contact me at gsharma14497@gmail.com. I cant work on it in my spare time free of cost.
