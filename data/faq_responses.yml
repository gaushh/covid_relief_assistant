  utter_faq/Transmission_-_Demographics:_General:
  - text: "older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions may be at higher risk for more serious complications from covid., based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for covid than adults. , the risk depends on where you are   and more specifically, whether there is a covid outbreak unfolding there. , we do not have information from published scientific reports about the susceptibility of pregnant women to covid. pregnant women experience immunologic and physiologic changes, which might make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections, including covid. , smoking cigarettes can leave you more vulnerable to respiratory illnesses such as covid. smoking cigarettes is known to cause heart and lung disease and people with underlying heart and lung problems may have increased risk for serious complications from covid., e cigarette use can expose the lungs to toxic chemicals, but whether those exposures increase the risk of covid or the severity of covid outcomes is not known., this is not a good time to be vaping or smoking anything. , younger people seem to be insulated to some extent to protect them from getting particularly sick., researchers do not have information from published scientific reports about susceptibility of pregnant women to this covid., based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for covid than adults. , based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from covid. , its not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from covid., most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from covid., those in complex humanitarian crises, which lack the infrastructure, support, and health systems to mount a comprehensive response. , patients with underlying medical conditions and the elderly, smokers were 1.4 times more likely (rr1.4, 95% ci 0.98 2.00) to have severe symptoms of covid and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to an icu, need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non smokers (rr2.4, 95% ci 1.43 4.04), the risk depends on where you live or where you have travelled recently. the risk of infection is higher in areas where a number people have been diagnosed with covid. , while we are still learning about how covid 2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
  utter_faq/Transmission_-_Survivability:_Surfaces:
  - text: "Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products, or packaging.
